/**
 * Turning what somebody typed into a mention the server can act on.
 *
 * A mention is not decoration. `@dan` in a message is why Dan's inbox lights up, why the channel
 * shows a mention badge rather than an unread one, and why he is notified even when the channel is
 * muted. The server reads that from a `mention` node in the document — plain text saying "@dan"
 * does nothing at all.
 *
 * The composer is a plain textarea, so this is how the two meet: when somebody picks a person from
 * the menu, the composer records the exact text it inserted alongside the user id. On send, those
 * recorded runs become `mention` nodes and everything else stays text. Editing the inserted text
 * breaks the match, and the mention degrades to plain text — which is honest, because at that point
 * it is no longer the name that was picked.
