 * What this module lets somebody do, and what this workspace has switched on.

 *
 * - a **permission** is about the person. Hide what they may never do; disable — with a reason —
 *   what they cannot do right now. Somebody else in the same workspace may well see it.
 * - a **capability** is about the workspace. When it is off the feature is not there for anyone,
 *   the shell never renders the contribution, and the API answers 404 rather than 403.
 *
 * The server checks both again regardless. This is about not offering a door that will not open.
